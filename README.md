# Multi class classifier model for media tags
This model forms part of the web app I created for the Qloo LLM Hackathon. It receives formated tags from media entities and clasiffies them to narrative components such as characters, genres, subgenres...

## Model and Dataset
- Type of model: The initial model relies on the pretrained DistilBERT. Semi-supervised Learning was employed. 
- Source: The model was trained with around 450 labeled tags from the Qloo api taste usage and related entity tags. 
- Description: It is a combination from movies, books and tv_shows, and cross domain entities like artists and destinations. Here an example with base format: "urn:tag:keyword:media": "dragonfly"
- Preprocessing: The tags were formated to match a format like "keyword:media:dragonfly", mainting the type,source and value.
- 
## Training and Evaluation
- Hardware: Training was performed on a GPU (T4) on Google Colab.
- Training Time: Approximately 40 minutes.
- Overall accuracy of around 74

## Usage
The model can classify tags suchs as" wildlife" as part of the topics of a narrative, "child in forest" as a story's character. All the categories can be found in the file int_to_category.json

## Local Installation
1. Install Python dependencies: 
Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and install the required packages.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
2. Run the local server:
Execute the app.py file to start the server. This will make the tag classification model available to receive requests.
